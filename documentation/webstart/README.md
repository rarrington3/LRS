Webstart is a simple web starter kit using Grunt, Babel, Browserify and several other tools. All the basic tasks you 
need for web development are included, from packaging, minification, concatenation, testing, serving, scaffolding... 
Webstart is an orchestration of many of the best open source web tools available in a comprehensive and integrated
workflow.

The core Webstart project is platform agnostic. The scaffolds and dependencies are fairly slim and doesn't 
include much to get you going by itself, instead we have many platform specific forks which introduce dependencies
and scaffolds specific to a platform and/or framework such as Angular, Angular2, Backbone...and many more.

Webstart is intended to act as a starter project for your own projects. You will want to [fork](../../../?fork) this project 
to your personal or project page in stash and setup the fork synching features so that you can easily pull in any 
new features and bug fixes from Webstart back into your project.

Once you have [forked](../../../?fork) this project and cloned your fork to your machine, follow the simple 
[setup](./SETUP.md) instructions to prepare your environment. For a brand new project that hasn't yet been initialized,
you will automatically walk through a series of questions to configure your project and setup some defaults:

    [?] What name do you want to give your application? webstart
    [?] Which stylesheet format would you like to set as your default? css
    [?] Do you require cordova for your application? (y/N)

See the [tasks](./TASKS.md) section for more information about available Grunt tasks included in this project.

Webstart is a KPMG community project, so please be sure to follow the guidelines for [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) 
because we'd love to have you helping to submit your bugfixes and feature enhancements for the benefit of everyone.
